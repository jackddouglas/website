      I believe all people should have the capacity to fully reify themselves.
      The current technological landscape hinders the free flow and coagulation
      of information, and thus the evolution of the human spirit. I aim to build
      tools that empower people to act, organise, and operate through means that
      respect the person and enrich the mind.

      I'm the founding engineer at
      <a href="https://tonk.xyz/" class="link">Tonk Labs</a>, a startup in hot
      pursuit of the liberated web. Most our time is spent building a framework
      for backendless, ephemeral software.

      Previously, I spent a year studying
      <a href="https://eecs.berkeley.edu/" class="link"
        >electrical engineering and computer science</a
      >
      at UC Berkeley, where I contributed to
      <a href="https://blockchain.studentorg.berkeley.edu/" class="link"
        >Blockchain@Berkeley</a
      >.

      I spend my free time exploring the speculative landscape of protocols and
      reading critical theory. I'm currently experimenting with structures that
      take senses of locality, trust, and agency, and proliferate them to a
      planetary scale.
